# Compass Beta V1.0 Feedback
**Date Collected:** January 12, 2026

---

## 📊 App Stability
- **No Freezing Reported:** The majority of responses indicated that the app did not freeze or that there was no freezing situation to report.

---

## 📝 Input & Data Entry

### GPA Input
- Users can input a GPA above 4.0, which needs clarification
- **Recommendation:** Make it clear that users should input their **unweighted GPA** to create consistency among different users from different locations

---

## 🎨 User Interface (UI) Issues

### Visual Design
- Colors are not good
- Theme is not friendly to all audiences
- UI is overall confusing

### Layout & Spacing
- Spacing on the "Target Locked" page is off
- ROI Rating is placed way too far below the cooldown section
- Font color for ROI Rating being different from "COOLDOWN" doesn't make sense visually (feels messy, in progress)
- ROI Rating is too close to the "Execute Mission" button
- "Execute Mission" button is too close to the bottom of the screen - doesn't look good
- **Recommendation:** Increase margins throughout

---

## 🧭 Navigation & User Flow

### General Navigation
- Having to restart every time is a hindrance
- Constant pop-ups are annoying
- Needs an onboarding process

### Tutorial Navigation
- In the tutorial pop-ups, there's no way to go back - users can only keep going forward
- **Recommendation:** Add ability to go back in tutorials (for accidental forwards or re-reading definitions)

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- **Recommendation:** Add a banner to the bottom for easy access to:
  - Base (Home)
  - Profile
  - Saved Missions
  - Other key features
- *Reference: Similar to TikTok's bottom banner*

---

## 💾 Saved Missions & Path Management

### Current Issues
- Currently, users can only see the cooldown period and college name for saved paths
- Cannot make meaningful insights after saving a path
- Saved missions are grouped with other information when they should be separate

### Recommendations
1. Allow users to **edit already saved paths** (delete, update, or view full details)
2. Allow users to **star or favorite** paths they like
3. Create a **separate page for saved missions** - don't group with profile features (field manual, dark mode, system override)
4. **Separate profile features** from saved missions since saved missions are the most important part of the app

---

## 🔗 External Resources

### Missing Features
- No links to important external pages

### Recommendations
- Offer links to important pages such as:
  - College website
  - Program website
  - Other relevant resources
- **Rationale:** Students shouldn't have to manually type in programs they like from their phone to search elsewhere (reduces convenience, adds work)

---

## 👤 Profile & Account Features

### Current Issues
- Cannot see any basic profile information
- No visibility of: email, username, profile pic, etc.

### Recommendations
- Display basic profile information
- Include email functionality so users can **email themselves a copy of reports they like**

---

## 💰 Cost Information

### Recommendations
- Show **in-state vs. out-of-state costs** for colleges

---

## � School Selection Criteria (Missing Factors)

### Current Limitation
- The app currently focuses primarily on cost/ROI when evaluating schools
- Users need more comprehensive information to make informed decisions

### Recommended Additional Data Points
1. **Program Rankings** - How programs rank nationally/regionally
2. **Location & Environment**
   - Is it a small college town or a major city?
   - Urban vs. rural setting
   - Surrounding area vibes and opportunities
3. **Campus Safety** - Crime statistics and safety ratings
4. **Demographics Breakdown**
   - Student body composition
   - Diversity statistics
5. **Special Institution Types**
   - HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities)
   - Women's-only colleges
   - Other special designations

---

## �🎮 Language & Theme

### Issues
- Language is confusing
- Video game terminology may not resonate with all users

### Recommendations
- Provide translations for gaming language (e.g., "squad support" → "family assistance")
- Consider making theme more accessible to broader audiences
